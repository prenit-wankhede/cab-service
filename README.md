* Overview of Backed architecture
	
	* We have used MVC architecture of rails 

	* List of Models

		* CabRequest:  
			id,  
			customer_id,  
			driver_id,  
			status,  
			created_at,
			updated_at,  
			finished_at

	* List of Controllers

		* ApplicationController (Rails default) responsible for initial handling of all requests that come to server
			
			enable/disable Devise user authentication by commenting out the 'authenticate_user!'' line
		
		* CabRequestsController

			* Methods

				index: returns drivers waitin, ongoing and complete cab requests  
				
				create: creats a new cab request for given customer  
				
				process_request: allocates given request to given drive if driver is available and request is not picked by other driver

		* CustomersController

			* methods

				index: renders HTML page for customer app			

		* DriversController

			* methods
